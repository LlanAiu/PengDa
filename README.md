A exploratory side project to throw machine learning at a long-time favorite game of mine, Mahjong.

Just as a warning, the purpose isn't to produce an incredibly accurate ML model - that said, a swap to a more appropriate policy gradient method is probably necessary at some point, seeing as it plays questionably (at best).

Also as an warning, the current UI - I'll just say it's not the most user friendly.
