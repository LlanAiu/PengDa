A exploratory side project to throw machine learning at a long-time favorite game of mine, Mahjong.

# Motivations
Just as a warning, the purpose isn't to produce an incredibly accurate ML model - that said, a swap to a more appropriate policy gradient method is probably necessary at some point, seeing as it plays questionably (at best).

Also as an warning, the current UI... We'll say it's not the most user friendly, or polished, or even anything more than a scrappy test platform... Moving along.

Ok really, the project is just an excuse to learn some more Java, OOP design, and some basic design patterns.

Also, it's a fun chance to put some reinforcement learning theory into practice.

And yes, there's a lack of libraries on purpose, I thought it'd be beneficial to do the logic by hand from a "rising-college-freshmen-with-plenty-of-interest-but-little-experience" standpoint.
